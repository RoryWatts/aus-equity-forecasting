# Personal Finance Calculator
This is a small command-line utility to help me understand how my finances look under different scenarios.
The basic idea is to handle basic accounting streams (assets, expenses, liabilities and revenues)
The streams are set-up at t0 and can change over time.
The calculations work as basic ledger accounting, where records are added to a ledger over time.
